## About the Nexis Network 
* Nexis Network uses a modular architecture and provides Ethereum compatibility.
* Users able to interact with industry standard wallets through JSON-RPC.
* Develop with Solidity/Vyper, full EVM support.
* Build using widely-adopted Ethereum tooling, libraries and development tools.
* Streamlined UX when doing cross-chain operations.
* Go beyond Ethereumâ€™s Smart Contracts with Runtime plugins.

The Nexis Network Token (NZT) features the following utilities, and the value of NZT token will accrue with the increased usage of the network and revenue from stability fees and liquidation penalties.

* As Network Utility Token: to pay for network fees and stability fees.
* As Governance Token: to vote for/against risk parameters and network change proposals.
* As Economic Capital: in case of liquidation without sufficient collaterals.
* As fee reducing token on decentralized applications and wallets upon the Exzo Network.
* For staking to help secure the Nexis Network in a decentralized fashion.

Cross-Chain Communication
* Completely trustless and decentralized built-in Ethereum Bridge solution.
* Transfer assets to and from any EVM compatible network, most notably Nexis Network and Ethereum mainnets.
* Transfer ERC-20 tokens, NFTs or wrapped native currencies.
* Customize the bridge functionality using Bridge plugins.

## Building

### **1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.**

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt
```

Please sure you are always using the latest stable rust version by running:

```bash
$ rustup update
```

On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, etc.  On Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang make cmake protobuf-compiler
```

On Mac M1s, make sure you set up your terminal & homebrew [to use](https://5balloons.info/correct-way-to-install-and-use-homebrew-on-m1-macs/) Rosetta. You can install it with:

```bash
$ softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

### **2. Download the source code.**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ExzoNetwork/exzocoin.git
$ cd exzocoin
```

### **3. Build.**

```bash
$ cargo build
```

### **4. Run a minimal local cluster.**
```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

## Testing

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
$ cargo test --no-fail-fast
```

#### EVM integration
Info about EVM integration is at our [docs](https://docs.exzo.technology/evm).

#### Starting a local testnet
Start your own Development network locally, instructions are in the [online docs](https://docs.exzo.technology/cluster/bench-tps).

#### Accessing the remote testnet and mainnet
* `testnet` - public accessible via bootstrap.rpc-test-1.nexis.network.
* `mainnet` - public accessible via bootstrap.exzo.technology.

## Benchmarking

First install the nightly build of rustc. `cargo bench` requires use of the
unstable features only available in the nightly build.

```bash
$ rustup install nightly
```

Run the benchmarks:

```bash
$ cargo +nightly bench
```

## Release Process
